# 323.Number of Connected Components in an Undirected Graph

You have a graph of n nodes. You are given an integer n and an array edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between ai and bi in the graph.

Return the number of connected components in the graph.

## Example:
```

Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[3,4]]
Output: 2

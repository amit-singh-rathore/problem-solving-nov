# 968. Binary Tree Cameras

Given a binary tree, we install cameras on the nodes of the tree. 

Each camera at a node can monitor its parent, itself, and its immediate children.

Calculate the minimum number of cameras needed to monitor all nodes of the tree.

## Example:
```
Input: [0,0,null,0,0]
Output: 1
Explanation: One camera is enough to monitor all nodes if placed as shown.
```

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the given tree will be in the range `[1, 1000]`.
- Every node has value 0.

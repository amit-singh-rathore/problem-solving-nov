## Minimum Moves to Equal Array Elements II

Given a list paths of directory info, including the directory path, and all the files with contents in this directory, return all the duplicate files in the file system in terms of their paths. You may return the answer in any order.
Given an integer array nums of size n, return the minimum number of moves required to make all array elements equal.

In one move, you can increment or decrement an element of the array by 1.

Test cases are designed so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.

## Example:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: 2
```

## Constraints

- n == nums.length
- 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
- -109 <= `nums[i]` <= 10^9

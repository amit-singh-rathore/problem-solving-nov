# 1037. Valid Boomerang

Given an array points where `points[i] = [xi, yi]` represents a point on the X-Y plane, return true if these points are a boomerang.

A boomerang is a set of three points that are all distinct and not in a straight line.

## Example

```
Input: points = [[1,1],[2,3],[3,2]]
Output: true

```

## Constraints

- points.length == 3
- `points[i].length` == 2
- 0 <= xi, yi <= 100

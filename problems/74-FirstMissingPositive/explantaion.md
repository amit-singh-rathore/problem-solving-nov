# Explanation

According to the constraint 0 <= nums.length <= 300. Hence the missing number will has to be >=300.
We create a array of 300 elemnets. Then we travers the original if the number is in range 0<=num<=300 we increament the value at the num index in the array. 
Later on we find the index which has zero(was not found in the original array).

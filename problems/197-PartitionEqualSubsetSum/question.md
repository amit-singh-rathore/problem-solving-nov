# 416. Partition Equal Subset Sum

Given a non-empty array nums containing only positive integers, find if the array can be partitioned into two subsets such that the sum of elements in both subsets is equal.

## Example

```
Input: nums = [1,5,11,5]
Output: true
Explanation: The array can be partitioned as [1, 5, 5] and [11].

```

## Constraints

- 1 <= nums.length <= 200
- 1 <= `nums[i]` <= 100

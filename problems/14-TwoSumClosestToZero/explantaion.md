# Explanation

## Will solve the problem with sorting and then using two pointers

1. Sort the array, ascending order. 
2. Now we will have two pointer one from left and one from right 
3. if the sum of values at arrays right index and left index is +ve then we want to reduce the sum(move closer to zero) hence will decrease the pointer from right. 
4. if the sum of values at arrays right index and left index is -ve then we want to increase the sum(move closer to zero) hence will increase the pointer from left

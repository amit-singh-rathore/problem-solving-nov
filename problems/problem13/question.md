# Max Continuous Series of 1s

Given an array of **1s** and **0s**, an integer **m**, where **m** signifies max number of flips allowed, Find the positions of Zeros which when flipped will produce longest continuous series of 1s.

#### Example:
```
array = [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]
m = 2

Output: [5, 7]

```

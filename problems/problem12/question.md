# Write a program to find the equilibrium index of an array. Equilibrium index of an array is an index such that sum of elements at lower indexes = sum of elements at higher indexes.

## Example

```Input: A[] = {-7, 1, 5, 2, -4, 3, 0}
Output: 3
Explanation: 3 is an equilibrium index, because:
a[0] + a[1] + a[2] = a[4] + a[5] + a[6]```

# Find K Pairs with Smallest Sums

You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2 sorted in ascending order and an integer k.

Define a pair (u,v) which consists of one element from the first array and one element from the second array.

Find the k pairs (u1,v1),(u2,v2) ...(uk,vk) with the smallest sums.

## Example

```
Input: nums1 = [1,7,11], nums2 = [2,4,6], k = 3

Output: [[1,2],[1,4],[1,6]] 

```

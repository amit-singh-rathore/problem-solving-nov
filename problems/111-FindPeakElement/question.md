# Find Peak Element

A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given an integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that `nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞`.

## Example
```
Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]

Output: 5
```

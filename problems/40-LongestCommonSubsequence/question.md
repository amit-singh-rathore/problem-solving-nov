#  Longest common subsequence
Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters(can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.
A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

## Example

```
Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 

Output: 3

```

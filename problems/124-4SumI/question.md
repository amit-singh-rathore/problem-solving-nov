# 4Sum I

Given an array nums of n integers and an integer target, are there elements a, b, c, and d in nums such that `a + b + c + d` = target? 
Find all unique quadruplets in the array which gives the sum of target.

## Example
```
Input: nums = [1,0,-1,0,-2,2], target = 0

Output: [[-2,-1,1,2],[-2,0,0,2],[-1,0,0,1]]

```

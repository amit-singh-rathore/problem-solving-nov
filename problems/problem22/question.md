# Minimum Cost to Reach the End
Given an array of integers and integer K, each integer in the array represents the cost to reach the corresponding index and K represents the maximum hops. 
The goal is to find the minimum cost to reach the last index in the array starting from the beginning.

## Example

```
arr = [20, 30, 40, 25, 15, 20, 28]
k = 3

output = 73
```

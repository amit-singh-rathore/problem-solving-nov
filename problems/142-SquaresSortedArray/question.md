# Squares of a Sorted Array

Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order.

# Example

```
Input: nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10]
Output: [0,1,9,16,100]
```

# Constraint

```
1 <= nums.length <= 104
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.
```

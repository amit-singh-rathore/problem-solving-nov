# Remove Zero Sum Consecutive Nodes from Linked List

Given the head of a linked list, we repeatedly delete consecutive sequences of nodes that sum to 0 until there are no such sequences.

After doing so, return the head of the final linked list.  You may return any such answer.

## Example
```
Input: head = [1,2,-3,3,1]

Output: [3,1]
```
